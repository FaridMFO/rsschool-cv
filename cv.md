###I am a humanist, I have always worked with documents in the public service and at one moment I realized that careers cannot be built on this. 
I decided to open a new stage in my life and direct all my efforts to the study of IT technologies and languages. 
This field of activity will give me a new breath of fresh air and help me depend more on myself than on my superiors.
###I studied not so long ago html and css. I know how these languages work and the rules for writing code. It's hard while coping with JS.
```  slides.forEach((slide) => {
        slide.classList.remove('active');
    });
};``
###No experience, only small practical work.
###Self-learning through YouTube
